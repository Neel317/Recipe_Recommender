   <h3>üçî Our motto: Eat good, Be Healthy, Stay Happy üçî</h3>

  <p>
    Recipe Recommender is an application that suggests you recipes based on the ingredients which are currently available.
    One of the most tedious tasks while cooking is figuring out what to cook with the ingredients that you, have rather than how to cook it.
    Our software aims to ease this dilemma by providing recipes for food items which you can make with the ingredients at your home.
  </p>

## Documentation

Recipe Recommender is a website that suggests users simple food recipes based on ingredients provided.

- [ ] The interface can take multiple ingredients from user as an input.
- [ ] The interface can also takes the type of cuisine the user wants.
- [ ] For each recipe, we show the key ingredients, instructions and a sample image.
- [ ] Upon user request we also send the list of recipes to the user.

Source documentation can be found at: [Recipe Recommender Docs] https://github.com/Shubh-Nisar/Recipe_Recommender/blob/master/Docs/Recipe%20Recommender%20Source%20Documentation%20-%20Google%20Docs.pdf
